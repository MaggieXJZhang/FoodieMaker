                <h3>Reflow Soldering - UW Robotics Team</h3>
                <h4>Feb. 2018</h4>
                <div class = "summary">
                <p>Being part of the electrical team member on the team, I helped with reflow soldering the boards. Putting solder paste and flux on the
                plates manually without stencils required lots of patience, but the process was rewarding.</p></div>

                <h3>ElectroBoosts - Course Design Project</h3>
                <h4>Sept. - Dec. 2017</h4>
                <div class = "summary">
                <p>Our team focused on preventing ankle sprains in
                child basketball players. We followed the formal engineering design cycle. From researching
                 the problem to Situation of Concern chart, from Quality Function Deployment to requirements
                  and constraints, we then designed several proof of concepts, medium, and high fidelity prototypes. The
                  final product had an arduino nano in the shoe sole along with a gyroscope and accelerometer to detect the motion of the feet. It also
                  has a sock sleeve with embedded electromagnets to reallign the ankle during landing.</p></div>

                <h3>Line Following Music Player - UW Robotics Zero Competition</h3>
                <h4>Sept. - Dec. 2017</h4>
                <div class = "summary">
                <p>My partner and I built a line following music player robot to compete in the UW Zero competition. The robot
                would run across greyscales on the floor and play music notes accordingly. From this, I learned basic circuitry, such as the usage and
                implementation of Op Amps, R2R bridge. I also implemented a light sensor using photoresistors and designed a arduino program to
                process the light sensitivity data.</p></div>

                <h3>3D Puzzle - CAD Project</h3>
                <h4>Oct. 2017</h4>
                <div class = "summary">
                <p>As part of the assignment of the Computer Aided Design course, we were asked to design and 3D print a 3D puzzle
                that could be played by our peers. Using SolidWorks and Zortrax printers, we created a maze. The player would rotate the game board by controlling the two side knobs
                to move the ball from start to finish without falling into the traps. It turned out to be quite challenging to win and very fun to play with! </p></div>

                <h4>Sept. 2017</h4>
                <div class = "summary">
                <p>As an introduction to the machine shop, we were asked to contruct a truck using the raw materials given, such as wood, steel, and aluminum.
                Machines used involved vertical band saw, brake, sheer etc. Tapping, binding, and sanding techniques were also practised. </p></div>
