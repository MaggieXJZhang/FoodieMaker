          <p>I am a foodie and I am a maker. Also, I cook delicious food so I have the magic power to make my guests foodies as well!</p>
          <p>The foodie side of me started when I was very little. Refusing to do my homework, I found the kitchen fasinating. Looking at my grandparents
          prepping foods and turning raw ingredients into delicacies felt like magic. So I started helping as soon as I could. Rolling out dumpling wrappers with my mini rolling pin, 
          making pizza with help from my mom, and helping out on prepping veggies, etc. As I grew older, I started trying out recipes I found online and spending all day testing recipes. Now, living on my own, and under the time pressure of university, I cook fast and deliciously. Wanna see what
          I eat? Check out <a href="foodie.html">this!</a></p>
          <p>Am I a maker? Well, if not yet, I am in progress. Watching my grandpa repairing small objects and helping him has planted the seed of "maker" in me. I devoured the process of
          building and repairing. Thanks to the Gr. 8 Applied Skills class, I got better. From screwing back screws, to repairing hair clippers, to soldering inners of my handheld mixer, I
          have to say, my mom saved lots of money from buying new ones because of me.</p>
          <p>To become better at the art of making, I am learning fast! From tech newbie to mastering SolidWorks, basic Arduino, Python, C#, and C++, I believe I will be a true maker soon!

            <h3>Acknowlegement</h3>
            <p>Special thanks to my family who have supported all my weird interest of building, repairing, cooking when I was a child. I wouldn't have made this far into cooking and making without the support and encouragement
          of you all, who have chosen not to force me into the typical interest class of my peers, who have eaten some of my worst productions with compliments, and who have allowed me messing the kitchen and balcony countless times.</p>
